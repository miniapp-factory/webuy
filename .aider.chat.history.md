#### Code the following app  
#### ```  
#### Bullish cryptocurrency buy signals  
#### ```  
####   
#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

Please add the file `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` to the chat so I can edit its title and description. Once that file is added, I’ll also create the new `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` file for the app logo.

A stylized, dynamic logo featuring a bold, green bull head emerging from a stylized, glowing cryptocurrency coin. The bull’s horns curve upward, forming a subtle upward arrow, symbolizing bullish market momentum. The coin is rendered with a metallic sheen and a faint digital grid overlay, hinting at blockchain technology. The background is a deep navy gradient that fades to black at the edges, giving the logo a sleek, modern look. The overall composition conveys confidence, growth, and the excitement of crypto trading.
